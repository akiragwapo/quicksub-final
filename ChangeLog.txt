Changes made by Josh: 6/29/13

Added a menu to the main screen that displays the options "New Sub", "Saved Subs", "Share Sub", "Receive Sub", and "Share via Facebook"
-This was implemented in the java file "Main.java" and by adding the resource layout file, "List_option.xml"

Added two buttons: Save Sub and Return. These buttons don't have any functionality yet.
The Return button is supposed to cause the app to return back to the menu screen, but I couldn't
figure out how to do that.
